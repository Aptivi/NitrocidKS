Nitrocid KS 0.1.1 changes
=========================

Released July 23rd, 2024; codename (Magikaleidoscope) (0.1.1) (Rev 18)

=============================================================================

0.1.1.17 - Service Pack 1 (September 10th, 2024)
================================================

This service pack release is a long-awaited release that enhances your Nitrocid
KS experience by adding some new features and fixing bugs left and right. Your
Nitrocid homepage has become smarter than before, with your mods being able to
register their applications to the homepage as an option.

The Nitrocid Homepage
---------------------

Your mods can finally register their applications to the homepage, making them
more easily accessible without having to type the command that corresponds to
the action that you put, such as opening an interactive TUI that shows you a
list of units to be converted. We've added some more options to the homepage
with the extra addons adding their applications to the same area, making them
more accessible.

Timers and Stopwatches
----------------------

We've made the UI of both the timer and the stopwatch applications more modern
then before by utilizing the latest design language that Terminaux 5.0
introduced using the rounded corners. In addition to that, you can now see the
full list of all the laps in the stopwatch application, as well as fixed some
issues.

Events and Reminders
--------------------

The list of events and reminders in the calendar textual user interface (TUI)
is now less cluttered, with grouping of all the events in a single day,
including annual events that last two or more days. You'll now see a much
cleaner interface then before when looking for events and reminders. You can
also see events and reminders in a single day by a single key press.

Security Improvements
---------------------

In the login screen, you are now required to sign in to your account before
being able to shut down or reboot the simulated kernel to avoid unwanted
disruptions. This account must either be an administrator or have power
management permissions in order to be able to initiate a shut down or a reboot.

Nitrocid LIVE!
--------------

Initially introduced in 0.1.1.6, you can now try out Nitrocid in a minimal
Windows environment distribution, called Nitrocid LIVE! Based on Windows 11
24H2 Preinstallation Environment (PE), you can try the Windows version of
Nitrocid out without having to install Windows.

=============================================================================

The successor of the 0.1.0 series is now here, bringing you more features than
ever! This version of Nitrocid is supported for nine months starting from the
release date.

The Nitrocid Homepage
---------------------

Introducing you to The Nitrocid Homepage, where you can interact with the
simulated system using either your keyboard or your mouse thanks to the latest
Terminaux features that made this implementation possible. This homepage
provides you with the following features:

  - Taking a look at the current system time
  - Showing the three latest RSS feeds
  - Opening various interactive applications
  - Accessing the kernel settings without a shell

This homepage UI can be resized using either your terminal emulator's resize
feature or Terminaux's methods of setting the window geometry. Of course, you
can turn this feature off using the kernel settings from the shell. You can
also log out from the homepage or go back to the shell. You can go back to the
homepage anytime you either log out and log back in, or write "exit" in the
main shell.

More interactive than ever
--------------------------

Nitrocid KS has become more interactive than ever by adding more interactive
TUIs that allow you to more easily manage tasks without the hassle of
memorizing shell commands to perform the same tasks, such as weather forecast
and the language studio. In addition, we've implemented the settings TUI so
that you can configure the kernel without having to go back one page to select
a section; you can now select a section in the first pane, while you can select
a configuration entry in the second pane, all in one interactive TUI!

In addition to that, we've now added full mouse support to countless
interactive applications so that you can now experience the easier-than-ever
kernel. This kernel version is the first one that provides complete mouse
support.

Playing radio stations
----------------------

You can now play remote radio stations hosted on the Internet using the music
player provided by the BassBoom.Extras addon. Just run the "musicplayer -r"
command and add your favorite radio station that BassBoom supports.
Unfortunately, you'll have to either find a radio station that hosts MPEG
streams or ask the radio host for the MPEG stream version.

BassBoom supports the following radio station servers:

  - SHOUTcast 1.0
  - SHOUTcast 2.0
  - IceCast

You can now play radio stations of differing genres from the 80's hits to
classical to hip-hop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and its subgenres.

Viewing images
--------------

You can now take a look at images right in your terminal without having to
open an external application on your host computer by using the "preview"
command, pointing it to any file path that points to an image file, with the
following non-exhaustive list of supported formats:

  - .JPG and .JPEG
  - .GIF
  - .PNG
  - .SVG

Thankfully, Terminaux is here to do the job as it uses ImageMagick to process
your images, making the preview tool the most powerful image viewing tool ever
implemented, because of ImageMagick's support for both common and uncommon
image formats that you can consult here:

Beep Synth
----------

This is not a typo; Beep Synth from 2018 is back! This time, we've implemented
it a bit differently, but we've made sure to keep the exact same goal of
playing a MIDI-like beep instrument from your PC speakers. We've changed the
format of the beep synth files (read: single instrument music cue sheet) to
the more powerful JSON file instead of a simple text file so that we can
implement the necessary checks.

Your typical beep synth file now looks like this (an example):

    {
        "name": "Song",
        "chapters": [
            {
                "name": "Chapter 1",
                "synths": [
                    "723 640",
                    "323 750",
                    "424 87"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Chapter 2",
                "synths": [
                    "400 800",
                    "600 800",
                    "800 800"
                ]
            },
        ]
    }

Beep synths used to look like this:

    KS-BSynth

    - Chapter 1
    323, 64
    323, 750
    424, 87

    - Chapter 2
    400, 500
    800, 1000
    400, 500
    800, 1000

Of course, the command name stays the same, so it's "beepsynth" after all. Now,
go ahead and make us listen to your "beep" synths!

More hashing algorithms
-----------------------

We've added more hashing algorithms to the Nitrocid kernel as part of the
Nitrocid Extras addon packs:

  - CRC32C (Castagnoli)
  - Enhanced SHA256 (SHA3-256)
  - Enhanced SHA384 (SHA3-384)
  - Enhanced SHA512 (SHA3-512)

Please note that you'll have to run Windows 11 24H2 or newer to be able to use
the Enhanced SHA algorithms. Any mod that uses one of the Enhanced SHA
algorithms and is being run on Windows 11 23H2 or older will fail to perform
hashing operations.

Other features
--------------

We are very sad to announce that one of the oldest features of Nitrocid KS, the
one that would allow you to show the date and the time in the corner, is phased
out in this version. This is in favor of The Nitrocid Homepage.

Now, it's your mission to guess what are the other features that we've added or
improved in this Magikaleidoscopic version of Nitrocid KS 0.1.1.
