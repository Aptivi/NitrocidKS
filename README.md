**WARNING: This version is no longer maintained. Please use 0.0.24.x or higher.**

Kernel Simulator simulates the future of our planned kernel that's coming as soon as it's finished. It consists of the kernel, the built-in shell known as UESH, and the built-in applications.

Not only it has some basic commands, but it also provides script support, network support, and tons of awesome things.

WARNING: Second-generation versions of KS is not backwards-compatible with the first-generation versions. Upgrade your mods to support the latest API changes.
