There is an error in the kernel or one of the kernel components. The below information may help you figure out why.
The error type is
The module that caused the fault provided this additional information that may help you further
The module that caused the fault didn't provide additional information.
Additionally, the faulty module provided this exception information
Also, the module didn't provide the exception information, so it's usually an indicator that something is wrong.
If the module tried to process your input, ensure that you've written all the parameters correctly.
Unknown kernel error.
The specified alias already exists. Make sure that you select a different alias.
The alias system encountered an invalid operation trying to process your request.
The specified alias isn't found.
The specified command isn't found to alias to.
The specified alias type isn't found.
An error occurred while trying to process the color request. Common mistakes include specifying the wrong color specifier.

Welcome to the kernel! Since this is the first time you start the kernel up, we'll initiate a simple console testing to determine whether it supports true color. Press any key to continue.
Do these ramps look right to you? They should transition smoothly.
Console supports true color
If you are sure that the console supports true color, or if you want to change your terminal to a terminal that supports true color, change this value.
The theme {0} needs true color support, but your console doesn't support it.
These settings are found. Please select one.
