## How do I run pre-boot command-line arguments?

You can run these arguments in the same concept as the command-line arguments. The only difference is that they execute before the kernel initialization.

### Useful arguments

| Argument            | Description
|:--------------------|:------------
| reset               | Resets the kernel to factory settings
| bypasssizedetection | Bypasses the console size detection
