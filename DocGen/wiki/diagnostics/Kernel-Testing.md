## What is kernel testing?

Kernel testing is the special feature which lets you interactively test some parts of the kernel. This shell is different from the unit testing, which covers most of the testable APIs.

Currently, it doesn't cover all of the mandatory kernel features, but it will cover everything as soon as possible in the next versions. It also lets you turn debugging on and off, and so the remote debugging feature.

To access the commands, click on [Test Shell](commands/Test-commands-for-KS.md).
